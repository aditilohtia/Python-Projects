# Python-Projects
Python Projects I came up with while learning Python

Project 1: Harry Potter Fill in the Blanks (HarryPotterFillinBlanks.py)

In this project, I created a fill in the blank game with famous Harry Potter quotes. The user will be prompted to pick one of ten quotes, 
and fill in the four blanks of the quote. If the user gets it right, they will start at the beginning of the game and have the opportunity
to pick another quote. They get three chances to fill in the blank. If they get all three guesses incorrect, the game will close.

Project 2: URL Shortener (bitly-api-python-master)

In this project, Bitly's API to create a URL shortener. The user will enter a website url and the program will give it corresponding shortened 
link. I utilized "Towards Data Science" for guidance on this mini project. 

Project 3: MP3 Player

Utilizing pygame and Tkinter libraries, I created an MP3 Player that allows users to load, play, pause, and stop the music. I referred to 
"Kalebu Jordan" for reference for this project.
